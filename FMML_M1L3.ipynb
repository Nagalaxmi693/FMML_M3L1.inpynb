        "Let us try one more augmentation: shear. Shear is the transformation of an image in which the x-coordinate of all points is shifted by an amount proportional to the y-coordinate of the point. We will use the `AffineTransform` function from the `skimage` module to shear the image by a small amount between two numbers. We will use the same naive grid search method to find the best hyperparameters for shear. We will use the best hyperparameters to train the model and check the accuracy on the test set."

        "## Questions\n",
        "Try these questions for better understanding. You may not be able to solve all of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is the best value for angle constraint and shear constraint you got? How much did the accuracy improve as compared to not using augmentations?\n",
        "\n",
        "Approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "Angle Constraint: This refers to rotating images by specific angles during augmentation (e.g., rotating by angles within a specified range like ±30° or ±45°). You can experiment with different ranges of angle constraints to see how much rotation helps in generalizing the model, especially when your dataset has varied orientations.\n",
        "Shear Constraint: This applies to shear transformations, which distort the image by slanting it. Shearing can simulate changes in perspective or object orientation. You can experiment with different shear values to see how they impact the model's ability to generalize.\n",
        "Experimentation:\n",
        "\n",
        "To find the best values, you would try several different angles and shear ranges (e.g., angle range of -45° to 45° vs. -30° to 30° or shear values between 0.2 to 0.4).\n",
        "Compare model performance (accuracy) when augmentations like rotations and shearing are used versus when they are not.\n",
        "Expected outcome:\n",
        "\n",
        "Typically, using augmentations improves the model’s generalization ability, especially if the dataset is limited or the objects have varying orientations.\n",
        "Accuracy improvement would depend on the dataset's diversity, but augmentations can prevent overfitting and help the model perform better on unseen data\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Can you increase the accuracy by increasing the number of augmentations from each sample?\n",
        "\n",
        "Apporach:\n",
        "\n",
        "Increasing Augmentations: In many cases, augmenting each sample multiple times (e.g., by rotating, flipping, scaling, etc.) can help create a more diverse training set, which can prevent the model from overfitting to any specific instance.\n",
        "Experimentation:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can experiment by augmenting each image with various transformations and creating multiple augmented versions (e.g., rotating by 30°, flipping horizontally, zooming in) and then training your model with this increased dataset.\n",
        "Compare the results between using a smaller number of augmented samples per image versus increasing the augmentations and re-evaluating the accuracy.\n",
        "Expected outcome:\n",
        "\n",
        "The model might improve by increasing the number of augmentations, as it could learn more robust features by seeing the same image from multiple perspectives.\n",
        "However, beyond a certain point, the law of diminishing returns applies, where adding too many augmentations can lead to longer training times without a significant improvement in accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Try implementing a few augmentations of your own and experimenting with them. A good reference is <a href=https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/12/image-augmentation-deep-learning-pytorch/>here. </a>\n",
        "\n",
        "Approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "The link provides an overview of different augmentation techniques like random rotation, flipping, zooming, shearing, etc. You can use libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow to implement augmentations.\n",
        "New Augmentations: Apart from common techniques, you could explore more advanced methods, such as:\n",
        "Random Erasing: Randomly occlude parts of an image to make the model focus on other parts.\n",
        "Color Jittering: Adjusting brightness, contrast, and saturation randomly.\n",
        "Cutout or Random Cropping: Randomly crop a portion of the image to force the model to focus on other areas.\n",
        "Experimentation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Implement these techniques and see how they affect the performance of the model on the training and validation sets.\n",
        "Expected Outcome:\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementing unique augmentations can help improve generalization. However, it is crucial to validate which augmentations are most useful for your dataset, as some techniques may negatively impact accuracy, depending on the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Try combining various augmentations. What is the highest accuracy you can get? What is the smallest training dataset you can take and still get accuracy above 50%?\n",
        "\n",
        "Approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "Combining Augmentations: Combining multiple augmentation techniques can sometimes have a better effect than using one augmentation alone. For example, applying random flips, rotations, and scaling together might increase diversity and prevent the model from learning too much from any single transformation.\n",
        "Experimentation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Start by combining several augmentations (e.g., rotation, flipping, color jittering, and random cropping) and train the model.\n",
        "Gradually reduce the size of the training dataset and track how the accuracy changes. The goal is to identify the smallest dataset that can achieve above 50% accuracy.\n",
        "Expected Outcome:\n",
        "\n",
        "Accuracy: Combining augmentations should help improve the model's accuracy, potentially pushing it above 50%, especially if your initial dataset is small.\n",
        "Smallest Training Dataset: The smallest dataset that can still achieve a certain level of accuracy depends on the complexity of the task and the augmentation techniques used. Typically, augmentations help significantly with small datasets, but there's a point where the model may still not generalize well if the dataset is too small.\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "The best approach would be to start with basic augmentations like rotation and flipping, then progressively try more complex transformations and combinations. Keep track of how the accuracy improves, and also monitor for overfitting. Fine-tuning the augmentation strategies based on experimentation will give you a deeper understanding of how data augmentation can improve model performance in machine learning tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whenever you do any experiment, a good practice is to vary the hyperparameters gradually and create a graph of your results, like we did for gridsearch."
